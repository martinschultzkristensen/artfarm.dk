          <h2>2017 and before</h2>
          <p>The project <i>danceOmatic</i> receives support from the foundation <i> Aarhus 2017, </i> to develop danceOmatic’s dance machine in a collaboration with <i> Le-Yun’s dance group </i> from Taiwan.
            The support spans 2016 and 2017. <br>
            In collaboration with Danish and Taiwanese dancers, musicians and stage builders, the concept is performed and developed in Taiwan. The software in the dance machine gets a functional boost, and the dance machine is made mobile and gets a new design.
            In Taiwan, five dancers operate in 2016; three from Taiwan and two from Denmark. eqaully so in Denmark in 2017.
